```js
const calcAge = (age) => age * 365;
```

## Strategy

The strategy for this implementation involves recognizing the objective of
calculating the approximate number of days lived based on the given age and
leveraging the simplicity and conciseness of arrow function syntax to achieve
the calculation efficiently.

## Implementation

This implementation of the calcAge function uses an arrow function syntax to
define the function in a concise manner. It takes an age as input and returns
the approximate number of days lived by multiplying the age by 365.

**Arrow function - implicit return**: This solution is a single expression so he
didn't need a `return` statement.

**Array literal (hard-coded values)**: He hard-coded all the right answers (in
order) into an array.

**Array access by index**: Since the parameter is a number, user used it as an
index to access the correct answer in the array.

## Possible Refactors

Refactoring options for the calcAge function include using a named constant for
the number of days in a year, adding parameter validation to ensure the input is
a valid number, and implementing unit tests to verify the function's behavior
under various conditions. These enhancements aim to improve readability,
robustness, and maintainability while ensuring accurate and reliable
functionality.

## References

For the implementation of the calcAge function, references may not be necessary
as it involves a simple mathematical operation without reliance on external
sources or prior work. However, if you were inspired by specific resources or
utilized existing knowledge to design this function, you could mention them in
your documentation or comments for clarity.
